A @racket[dc<%>] object is a drawing context for drawing graphics and
 text.  It represents output devices in a generic way; e.g., a canvas
 has a drawing context, as does a printer.


@defmethod[(cache-font-metrics-key)
           exact-integer?]{

Returns an integer that, if not @racket[0], corresponds to a
particular kind of device and scaling factor, such that text-extent
information (from @method[dc<%> get-text-extent], @method[dc<%>
get-char-height], etc.) is the same. The key is valid across all
@racket[dc<%>] instances, even among different classes.

A @racket[0] result indicates that the current configuration of
@this-obj[] does not fit into a common category, and so no key is
available for caching text-extent information.}


@defmethod[(clear)

Clears the drawing region (fills it with the current background color,
as determined by @method[dc<%> get-background]). See also @method[dc<%> erase].

Draws a counter-clockwise circular arc, a part of the ellipse
 inscribed in the rectangle specified by @racket[x] (left), @racket[y]
 (top), @racket[width], and @racket[height]. The arc starts at the angle
 specified by @racket[start-radians] (@racket[0] is three o'clock and
 half-pi is twelve o'clock) and continues counter-clockwise to
 @racket[end-radians]. If @racket[start-radians] and @racket[end-radians] are
 the same, a full ellipse is drawn.

The current pen is used for the arc. If the current brush is not
 transparent, it is used to fill the wedge bounded by the arc plus
 lines (not drawn) extending to the center of the inscribed ellipse.
 If both the pen and brush are non-transparent, the wedge is filled
 with the brush before the arc is drawn with the pen. 

The wedge and arc meet so that no space is left between them, but the
 precise overlap between the wedge and arc is platform- and
 size-specific.  Typically, the regions drawn by the brush and pen
 overlap.  In unsmoothed or aligned mode, the path for the outline is
 adjusted by shrinking the bounding ellipse width and height by, after scaling, one
 drawing unit divided by the alignment scale.

           boolean?]{

Displays the @racket[source] bitmap. The @racket[dest-x] and @racket[dest-y] arguments
 are in DC coordinates.

For color bitmaps, the drawing style and color arguments are
 ignored. For monochrome bitmaps, @method[dc<%> draw-bitmap] uses the
 style and color arguments in the same way that a brush uses its style
 and color settings to draw a monochrome stipple (see @racket[brush%]
 for more information).

If a @racket[mask] bitmap is supplied, it must have the same width and height
 as @racket[source], and its @method[bitmap% ok?] must return
 true, otherwise @|MismatchExn|. The @racket[source] bitmap and @racket[mask]
 bitmap can be the same object, but if the drawing context is a
 @racket[bitmap-dc%] object, both bitmaps must be distinct from the
 destination bitmap, otherwise @|MismatchExn|.

The effect of @racket[mask] on drawing depends on the type of the
@racket[mask] bitmap:
@;
@itemlist[

 @item{If the @racket[mask] bitmap is monochrome, drawing occurs in
       the target @racket[dc<%>] only where the mask bitmap contains
       black pixels (independent of @racket[style], which controls how
       the white pixels of a monochrome @racket[source] are handled).}

 @item{If the @racket[mask] bitmap is color with an alpha channel, its
       alpha channel is used as the mask for drawing @racket[source],
       and its color channels are ignored.}

 @item{If the @racket[mask] bitmap is color without an alpha channel,
       the color components of a given pixel are averaged to arrive at
       an inverse alpha value for the pixel. In particular, if the
       @racket[mask] bitmap is grayscale, then the blackness of each
       mask pixel controls the opacity of the drawn pixel (i.e., the
       mask acts as an inverted alpha channel).}

]

The current brush, current pen, and current text for the DC have no
 effect on how the bitmap is drawn, but the bitmap is scaled if the DC
 has a scale, and the DC's alpha setting determines the opacity of the
 drawn pixels (in combination with an alpha channel of @racket[source],
 any given @racket[mask], and the alpha component of @racket[color] 
 when @racket[source] is monochrome).

For @racket[post-script-dc%] and @racket[pdf-dc%] output, opacity from
 an alpha channel in @racket[source], from @racket[mask], or from 
 @racket[color] is rounded to full transparency or opacity.

The result is @racket[#t] if the bitmap is successfully drawn,
 @racket[#f] otherwise (possibly because the bitmap's @method[bitmap%
 ok?] method returns @racket[#f]).

 The current pen is used for drawing the path as a line, and the

If both the pen and brush are non-transparent, the path is filled with
 the brush before the outline is drawn with the pen. The filling and

Returns a rectangle that encloses the path’s points. 
The return values are the left, top, width, and, height of the rectangle.
The numbers are in logical coordinates.

For the type @racket['stroke] the rectangle covers the area that would be affected (``inked'')
when drawn with the current pen by draw-path in the drawing context (with a transparent brush). 
If the pen width is zero, then an empty rectangle will be returned. The size and clipping of the 
drawing context is ignored.

For the type @racket['fill] the rectangle covers the area that would be affected (``inked'')
by draw-path in the drawing context (with a non-transparent pen and brush). If the line width 
is zero, then an empty rectangle will be returned. The size and clipping of the drawing
context are ignored.

For the type @racket['path] the rectangle covers the path, but the pen and brush are ignored.
The size and clipping of the drawing context are also ignored.
More precisely: The result is defined as the limit of the bounding boxes returned
by the @racket['stroke] type for line widths approaching 0 with a round pen cap. The ``limit
process'' stops when an empty rectangle is returned. This implies that zero-area segments 
contributes to the rectangle.

For all types if the path is empty, then an empty rectangle @racket[(values 0 0 0 0)] 
will be returned.

Returns the size of @racket[str] as it would be drawn in the drawing
 context, starting from the @racket[offset] character of @racket[str],
 and continuing until the end of @racket[str] or the first null
 character.  The @racket[font] argument specifies the font to use in
 measuring the text; if it is @racket[#f], the current font of the
 drawing area is used. (See also @method[dc<%> set-font].)

The result is four real numbers:

@itemize[

 @item{the total width of the text (depends on both the font and the
 text);}

 @item{the total height of the font (depends only on the font);}

 @item{the distance from the baseline of the font to the bottom of the
 descender (included in the height, depends only on the font); and}

 @item{extra vertical space added to the font by the font designer
 (included in the height, and often zero; depends only on the font).}

]

The returned width and height define a rectangle is that guaranteed to
 contain the text string when it is drawn, but the fit is not
 necessarily tight. Some undefined number of pixels on the left,
 right, top, and bottom of the drawn string may be ``whitespace,''
 depending on the whims of the font designer and the platform-specific
 font-scaling mechanism.

If @racket[combine?] is @racket[#t], then @racket[text] may be drawn
 with adjacent characters combined to ligature glyphs, with Unicode
 combining characters as a single glyph, with kerning, with
 right-to-left ordering of characters, etc. If @racket[combine?] is
 @racket[#f], then the result is the same as if each character is
 drawn separately, and Unicode control characters are ignored.

Unlike most methods, this method can be called for a
 @racket[bitmap-dc%] object without a bitmap installed.

Returns @racket[#t] if the given character has a corresponding glyph

Due to automatic font substitution when drawing or measuring text, the
 result of this method does not depend on the given font, which merely
 provides a hint for the glyph search. If the font is @racket[#f], the
 drawing context's current font is used. The result depends on the
 type of the drawing context, but the result for @racket[canvas%]

@defmethod[(set-alignment-scale [scale (>/c 0.0)])
           void?]{

Sets the drawing context's @deftech{alignment scale}, which determines
 how drawing coordinates and pen widths are adjusted for unsmoothed or
 aligned drawing (see @method[dc<%> set-smoothing]).

The default @tech{alignment scale} is @racket[1.0], which means that
 drawing coordinates and pen sizes are aligned to integer values.

An @tech{alignment scale} of @racket[2.0] aligns drawing coordinates
 to half-integer values. A value of @racket[2.0] could be suitable for
 a @racket[bitmap-dc%] whose destination is a bitmap with a
 @tech{backing scale} of @racket[2.0], since half-integer values
 correspond to pixel boundaries. Even when a destinate context has a
 backing scale of @racket[2.0], however, an alignment scale of
 @racket[1.0] may be desirable to maintain consistency with drawing
 contexts that have a backing scale and alignment scale of
 @racket[1.0].

drawing is blended with the existing content of the drawing context.
A color (e.g. for a brush) also has an alpha value; it is combined

@defmethod[(set-smoothing [mode (or/c 'unsmoothed 'smoothed 'aligned)])
           void?]{

Enables or disables anti-aliased smoothing for drawing. (Text
 smoothing is not affected by this method, and is instead controlled
 through the @racket[font%] object.)

The smoothing mode is either @racket['unsmoothed], @racket['smoothed],
 or @racket['aligned]. Both @racket['aligned] and @racket['smoothed]
 are smoothing modes that enable anti-aliasing, while both
 @racket['unsmoothed] and @racket['aligned] adjust drawing coordinates
 to match pixel boundaries. For most applications that draw to the
 screen or bitmaps, @racket['aligned] mode is the best choice.

Conceptually, integer drawing coordinates correspond to the boundary
 between pixels, and pen-based drawing is centered over a given line
 or curve. Thus, drawing with pen width @racket[1] from @math{(0, 10)}
 to @math{(10, 10)} in @racket['smoothed] mode draws a 2-pixel wide
 line with @math{50%} opacity.

In @racket['unsmoothed] and @racket['aligned] modes, drawing
 coordinates are truncated based on the @tech{alignment scale} of the
 drawing context. Specifically, when the alignment scale is 1.0,
 drawing coordinates are truncated to integer coordinates. More
 generally, drawing coordinates are shifted toward zero so that the
 result multipled by the @tech{alignment scale} is integral. For line
 drawing, coordinates are further shifted based on the pen width and
 the alignment scale, where the shift corrsponds to half of the pen
 width (reduced to a value such that its multiplication times the
 alignment scale times two produces an integer). In addition, for pen
 drawing through @method[dc<%> draw-rectangle], @method[dc<%>
 draw-ellipse], @method[dc<%> draw-rounded-rectangle], and
 @method[dc<%> draw-arc], the given width and height are each
 decreased by @math{1.0} divided by the @tech{alignment scale}.}
